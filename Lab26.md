# Lab 26

## Lab Intent:
Configure a loopback interface and OSPF on each router.

## Thoughts: 
This lab mirrors the EIGRP lab. The key difference being the use of a protocol that isn’t proprietary to Cisco. We still cover the same things as the loopback interface and dynamic routing, we just use a different protocol.
