# Lab 8

## Lab Intent:
Configure the hostname on the router, following the IP address on each of the router’s interfaces. Then configure the IP addresses to the three PCs, ping them to verify.

## Thoughts:
This lab was very useful. I entered the wrong IP address subnet mask a time or two and kind of caught the error. So, it was nice having these safeguards to help along the way. But the most useful tool was the show commands used to check and make sure it was the write IP address with the correct subnet mask to make sure I am doing it correctly without a doubt. Then if I ping the PC and it doesn’t show up, I can fall back on the show commands to trouble shoot.
