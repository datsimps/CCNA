# Lab 12
## Lab Intent:
Source vs destination MAC addresses. Follow the ICMP and find the source and destination MAC addresses.

## Thoughts:
This was a very informative lab, in the same vein as Lab 6. This lab focused on the ping that must cross to other networks as well as within the same network. This lab feels like a lab focused on showing fundamentals opposed to teaching the use of very specific commands. I wrote the MAC addresses at each step in its own box, to keep track along the way.
