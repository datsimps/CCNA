# Lab 1

## Lab Intent: 
The first lab used Cisco’s PT; the purpose of the lab was to introduce the software. I followed the lab instructions on the side of the lab to place: routers, switches, firewalls, PCs, servers, and a laptop. After placing all the equipment, I then connected them to each other, to create the network.

## Thoughts: 
I can see that I can connect each of the equipment to a particular interface with a different physical cable. I can place the equipment anywhere I decide. This frees up the need for physical devices. I can tinker and play around. I like to know that if I have a theory, I can test it without disrupting the workflow of an organization.
