# Lab 16

## Lab Intent:
Configure VLANs and assign interfaces to the correct VLAN. Then test connectivity by sending pings to other PCs.

## Thoughts:
I had issues with testing connections between the PCs but the trouble shooting process wasn’t difficult. I learned the commands needed to set up the access ports and to show the brief to verify.
