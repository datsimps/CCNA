# Lab 11A

## Lab Intent:
There are no configurations on the devices, you must configure the network. Set the hostnames, IP addresses, descriptions, and default gateways. Ping one PC from the other to verify.

## Thoughts:
I like this, having fine control over the network. I made less mistakes than I have on the labs previous. The descriptions made things easier to kind of see what was going where, and what setting it needed because of where it was going. Over document, it helps. I included the screen shot of the ip route to help show the routes used.
