# Lab 3

## Lab Intent: 
Show a visual simulation of the OSI model. I pinged from one end host to another to see the different layers being used. Then released the PC’s IP address and renewed the IP address to show layer 7 traffic.

## Thoughts:
I liked the simulation tool. Showing the routing methods in action opposed to abstract concepts that aren’t elaborated for the student. Makes things easier to see where the trouble spots are in the network if something isn’t configured properly.
