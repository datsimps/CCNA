# Lab 2

## Lab Intent: 
Introduce the proper cable needed for a particular job. The cables used were fiber (although not differentiated between single mode vs multi-mode), straight through copper, and crossover copper.

## Thoughts: 
I saw that I can have precise control on the physical cable although the lab is software based. I like the software as a training aid, and maybe could be used down the road to help set up diagrams to illustrate points, like a presentation or visual to a difficult point.
