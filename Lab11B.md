# Lab 11B

## Lab Intent:
There is a network set up, but every router has an error made, find it, and fix it.

## Thoughts:
I loved this lab the most of all the labs. It feels like a lab that is going to come up in the real world far more often. Troubleshooting is a way of life, get good at it and get good at it early. Again, the inclusion of the routes used for verification/help.
