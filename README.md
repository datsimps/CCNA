# CCNA Labs
Software Used: Cisco’s Packet Tracer

Labs from: Jeremy's IT Lab

The files used are saved files from Cisco's Packet Tracer. I have included screenshots from the labs to include the useful information i.e., instructions,
questions, and diagrams. These files are my thoughts put down to illustrate my process or findings when concluding each of the labs.
