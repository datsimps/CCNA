# Lab 9

## Lab Intent:
Configure two switches, four PCs and a router with proper IP addresses, speed, duplex, and descriptions. Disable unused interfaces that are not connected.

## Thoughts:
With a programming background I like the ability to set the speed and duplex on the switches, leaving the less things on “auto” generally makes life easier. If I set something on auto, it could lead to more issues because I had no say on the things it changes. Using the "show int status" command allows for verification.
