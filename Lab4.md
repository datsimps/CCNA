# Lab 4

## Lab Intent:
Set the hostname of network devices and enable security for the devices. The lab showed how to enable unencrypted passwords on the devices as well as encrypting the passwords on the running-config. Then enabling the secret password as well to show which takes priority, the encrypted or unencrypted, then looking at the security level of each (5 or 7). ![Lab4 screenshot](/Lab4.jpg)

## Thoughts:
I noticed that anything following the command “enable secret” will be a part of the password. So, it acts like a passphrase instead of a password. This will act more as a lesson for setting passwords/phrases in the future. You can see here in this screenshot the different levels of password.
